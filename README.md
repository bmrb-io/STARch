# STARch

This is the nomenclature conversion part of what was previously called
"STAR conversion handler". It is a Java GUI tied to BMRB annotation 
workflow.

Original version history is in `starch.svndump.gz`, GNU `getopt` and
`sans` STAR parser classes are included for the build, older code is included
in `archive` subdirectory for posterity.
