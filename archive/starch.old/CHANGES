Fix handling of seqCode_label field in Format1. It must contain
residue label and sequence code as one string, e.g. A1. STARch 
was trying to parse that as sequence code + residue label (the 
other way around).

Documentation fixes.
Wrote custom method to validate floating-point numbers. It is 2 times
faster and understands scientific notation. Formats 1 and 4 are using 
it, more to follow.

Fixed bugs in formats 1 and 2 -- they were losing comments during conversion.
Added another tab-delimited format: format 4.

This version

 -- does not rename atoms from e.g. HB1, HB2 to HB2, HB3 in GLN.
    It leaves them as is instead, and marks HB1 as invalid atom.

 -- accepts residue type command-line parameter. That turns 
    nomenclature conversions on (they're now off by default).

 -- does not add chemical shift ambiguity code to atoms that have
    no chemical shift value.

 -- does not strip trailing zeroes from chemical shift value and
    error.

 -- quotes atom names properly.
