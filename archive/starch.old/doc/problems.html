<H1 class="center">Known problems</H1>
<P>  
  A very common problem with Format 2 and Nucleic Acid is using TABs
  instead of spaces in input file. The problem is that these formats
  specify starting column for each field. A TAB is a single character
  that occupies one column. However, it is usually rendered as 8 
  (or any number of -- this setting is user-definable) spaces on the 
  screen. So for example, if a field is supposed to be in column 8,
  but there is a TAB instead of 8 spaces before it, the field looks like
  it starts in column 8 but it actually starts in column 2. When STARch 
  tries to read the field, it will read the value in column 8, not 2. 
  Since it's perfectly OK to omit some values, this may not cause an error.
  <BR>
  In other words, if STARch runs into this problem, do not expect to 
  see any meaningful error messages and/or output.
<P>
  Space-delimited formats (Format 1 and Format 4) use standard Java 
  string tokenizer to split input line into fields (tokens). The
  tokenizer treats consecutive whitespace characters as one big
  whitespace. That means you must put something (e.g. "n/a" or a dash)
  in place of missing value, except when missing value is the last one 
  on the line. Otherwise chemical shift values will be assigned to wrong
  atoms.
<P>
  STARch cannot identify input format from the input file. If you
  specify an incorrect input format, the error message you are most
  likely to get is about invalid field name.
<P>
  With nomenclature conversions turned on, STARch will attempt to convert 
  residue labels, atom names, and supply atom types for each residue and
  atom. If you specify an incorrect residue type, STARch will convert
  them incorrectly.
  <BR>
  Also, residue type applies to the whole input file, so if the input 
  contains a mix of different residue types, some may get incorrectly
  converted.
