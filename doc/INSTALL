Installing script files on BMRB webserver is simple:

 * Copy all files except globals.txt from project's src directory to
   $DocumentRoot/software/starch on master website. After copying help
   subdirectory, rm -r $DocumentRoot/software/starch/help/.svn. Also,
   create $DocumentRoot/software/starch/tmp subdirectory.
 * Make sure php_includes/Globals.inc file in $DocumentRoot has the settings
   in globals.txt.
 * Add all new files and directories to CVS.

Everything should be mirrored to public webservers automatically.

The hard part: Chem. Comp. database must be installed on each webserver.
On the master:

 * Create PostgreSQL web user and chem_comp database (if needed)
 * Create tables, use schema.psql in project's sql directory
 * Load starch, datumtypes and tagmap tables from CSV file in sql directory

 You can use pg_dump to dump the entire database to a file, copy it to other servers,
 and use pg_restore to re-create it there.

 NOTE: other web applications use chem_comp database. Make sure you don't delete any
 of the other tables in chem_comp DB in the process.
