   <h1>STAR Conversion Handler</h1>
   <p>
     Web-based program for converting data files to NMR-STAR 3.1.
   <p>
   <em>Project location:</em> <strong>svn:///file/svn/websoft/starch</strong>
   <br>
   <a href="INSTALL">website installation instructions</a>
 
   <h2>Requirements</h2>
   <p>
     This is a pre-deposition tool for authors to convert their data to NMR-STAR 3.1 format for
     faster processing. It is also used by BMRB annotators if the authors didn't bother to do the
     conversion themselves. 
   <p>
     Main requirement is extensibility: it must be easy to add new input formats as they come
     along. Also, the program should not need to be rewritten every time NMR-STAR dictionary is
     updated.
   <p>
     Main limitation is nomenclature checking/conversion: in the previous version of STARch most
     users seemed to ignore warning messages about invalid atom names, and in a few cases the 
     nomenclature conversions that were done automatically actually made things worse. Because of
     that, this version of STARch does not do anything with residue and atom names.
   <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

   <h2>Interface</h2>
   <p>
     Similar to file import wizard in office programs: user clicks through a series of screens
     selecting data type and input file type. Final screen shows top 10 rows of converted table
     with column headers as drop-down lists: user can verify that data was placed in the right
     columns and change the headers if necessary. The end result is an NMR-STAR 3.1 loop.

<h1>TODO</H1>
<P>
  Most of this should be rewritten to use new chem_comp/curated DB.
   
   <h2>Implementation</h2>

   <h3>Dictionary database</h3>
   <p>
     <strong>TODO:</strong> add to chem_comp and get that installed on mirrors.
   <p>
     <tt>datumtypes</tt> table: maps tag category to human-readable description of data type, e.g.
     "chemical shifts". Used to populate the drop-down list of data types.
   <p>
     <tt>starch</tt> table lists all data tags (in categories in the above table) with the following
     flags:
     <ul>
       <li><tt>displseq</tt>: number for sorting tags on display (e.g. in STARch). There in case sorting by
           dictionary sequence number doesn't work.</li>
       <li><tt>displname</tt>: text shown in the column header drop-down box.</li>
       <li>flags that mark <em>Comp_ID</em>, <em>Seq_ID</em>, etc. tags, this way we don't have to base
           column selections on tag name (esp. in tables with several "value" columns that arent called <em>.Val</em>).
     </ul>
   <p>
     <strong>TODO</strong>: Dictionary tables reside in <tt>validict</tt> schema in chem_comp DB.

   <h3>Files</h3>
   <p>
     <strong>TODO</strong>: needs clean-up.
   <p>
     <tt>index.html</tt> + data type selector.
   <p>
     <tt>filesel.php</tt>: lists input formats for selected data types.
   <p>
     <tt>fileupl.php</tt>: file upload form. Runs appropriate converter for selected input format and data type.
   <p>
     Every converter is a separate PHP script that reads uploaded file and writes out a tab-delimited
     file in temp. directory w/ residue sequence number, residue label, atom name, shift value columns
     (usually in that order), and any other columns parsed out of input file. It returns array of NMR-STAR 3.1 tags
     in the same order as temp. file columns (where known).  
   <p>
     <tt>markcols.php</tt>: last input form. Displays first 10 rows of temp. file with column headers as drop-down
     lists. The lists are populated from <tt>starch</tt> table of validation dictionary database and include all
     "user-visible" tags for the table.
   <p>
     <tt>showstar.php</tt>: prints out NMR-STAR 3.1 table.
